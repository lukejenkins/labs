## Deliverables

For the assignment in Canvas, you need to send me proof that you have mapped out 10,000 unique Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) with GPS data.

The first method you can do is to attach a `CSV EXPORT DB` file from the WiGLE WiFi Wardriving App to the assignment in Canvas.

Another way is to create an account at <https://wigle.net/>, upload your data from the WiGLE WiFi Wardriving App, and then attach a screenshot of your user account page to the assignment in Canvas.
