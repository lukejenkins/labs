# Rate vs. Range Lab

Version 4.0

## Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the relationship between data rate and range in wireless networks. I will have multiple APs set up for each student to perform testing against. We will then measure the throughput and data rates used at various distances from the access point using a web-based speed test and the wavemon application.
